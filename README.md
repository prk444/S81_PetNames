# S81_PetNames

Project Title: Weird Pet Name Generator

Project Overview: A hilariously absurd tool that generates ridiculous pet names based on user preferences.
 Different users will see unique, bizarre name suggestions tailored to their chosen pet type.

Key Features:

User authentication to save and retrieve personalized weird pet names Randomized name generation based on pet type (dog, cat, etc.).
 Community-driven database where users can submit their own weird names Leaderboard for the most upvoted weird pet names.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js,Tailwind.
CSS Backend: Node.js,Express.js, MongoDB
Authentication: Firebase Auth 
Hosting: Frontend, Backend

Why This Project:

 I chose this project because pet names are often either too basic or too seriousâ€”this aims to change that with maximum absurdity.
Its a fun way to explore authentication, database interactions, and user-generated content while ensuring every pet has a truly unique (and ridiculous) identity.
